This is the new theme in version 3,  inspired by the Maximum Arcade frontend theme, and adapted for Retrobat v6.x.x, Batocera and future release.


Now you can update the theme through the Retrobat interface, by running the script I created or by launching the command "maximus_theme.bat which will start the download of the entire package containing both the theme and all the files that compose it (Video and Images), (only for Retrobat), for Batocera the script does not work since it uses a program that runs on windows.
